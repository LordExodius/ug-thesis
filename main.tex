\section*{Abstract}

Edge computing has been the subject of much attention in the software development space over the 
last several years as the limitations of traditional cloud computing models continue to be exposed 
by an increasing number of connected IoT and internet-enabled devices that require real-time 
computing. As this new computing paradigm becomes more prevalent in the industry, it is important 
that software is developed effectively to take advantage of the benefits that edge computing 
brings to the table.
\newline

In this paper, we attempt to establish an understanding of core principles that will enable the 
effective design and development of distributed software systems that can be easily deployed and 
optimized for various architectures of computing models -- primarily hybrid cloud edge networks.

\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Application Development}
Not all software is created equally, with a vast range of performance characteristics and
behaviour across various applications when developed for differing use cases. For the purposes
of demonstrating this behaviour in order to identify favourable conditions for edge deployments, 
we develop a minimal microservice-architecture application for real-time object recognition 
consisting of a web interface, API gateway/web server, and an inference service. (O1)\newline

- Hardware limitations
- Limited model selection
- Relatively simple system design
- Lack of edge deployments
