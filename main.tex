Edge computing has been the subject of much attention in the software
development space over the last several years as the limitations of traditional cloud computing 
models continue to be exposed by an increasing number of connected IoT and internet-enabled 
devices that require real-time computing. As this new computing paradigm becomes more prevalent 
in the industry, it is important that software is developed effectively to take advantage of the
benefits that edge computing brings to the table.
\newline

In this paper, we attempt to establish an understanding of core principles that will enable
the effective design and development of distributed software systems that can be deployed and 
optimized for various configurations of computing models -- primarily hybrid cloud edge networks.



% Over the last decade, distributed software systems that live on the 
% cloud have grown to be at the core of almost every piece of technology that humans interact with
% on a daily basis, resulting in a dramatic increase in demand for data processing and compute
% that traditional cloud computing models have strugged to keep up with. In the last few years,
% new distributed computing paradigms have begun to grow in popularity as a result, including 
% edge and fog computing, which distribute tasks to devices at the edge of the network rather 
% than a centralized server. In this
