\section*{Abstract}

Edge computing has been the subject of much attention in the software
development space over the last several years as the limitations of traditional cloud computing 
models continue to be exposed by an increasing number of connected IoT and internet-enabled 
devices that require real-time computing. As this new computing paradigm becomes more prevalent 
in the industry, it is important that software is developed effectively to take advantage of the
benefits that edge computing brings to the table.
\newline

In this paper, we attempt to establish an understanding of core principles that will enable the 
effective design and development of distributed software systems that can be easily deployed and 
optimized for various configurations of computing models -- primarily hybrid cloud edge networks.

\begin{itemize}
    \item {
        To develop a demo application with the ability to conditionally and automatically self 
        optimize in various network configurations.
        }
    \item { 
        Using this demo application:
        \subitem Determine the feasibility of using this approach in production environements
            \subsubitem What type of application can be designed this way?
            \subsubitem Is it possible to adapt existing applications to this framework?
        \subitem Analyze the benefits provided by self optimization 
            \subsubitem Platform compatibility
            \subsubitem Latency improvements
        \subitem Analyze the tradeoffs compared to traditional software design paradigms
            \subsubitem Additional development time
            \subsubitem Added complexity in maintainence
            \subsubitem Additional computing overhead
        \subitem Determine suitable environements in which this may be desired (if any)
